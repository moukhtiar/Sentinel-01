This repository contains my hands-on labs and detection projects using Microsoft Sentinel.

# Key Concepts
- Microsoft Sentinel as a cloud-native SIEM and SOAR platform
- Sentinel's role in a modern Security Operations Center (SOC)
- Integration with Microsoft Defender XDR for threat detection and response

# Lab Activities
- Deployed Microsoft Sentinel
- Connected Azure Activity Logs as data source
- Ran KQL queries to investigate sign-in patterns

# Sample KQL Query
```kql
SigninLogs
| summarize SignInCount = count() by UserPrincipalName
| order by SignInCount desc
